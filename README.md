# Efficient Pseudo spectral Algorithms for Statistical Field Theories

This repository contains the code and data used in the article "Efficient Pseudo-spectral Algorithms for Statistical Field Theories".
The repository is split into two submodules.
To get everything, run 

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/martkjoh/Efficient-Pseudo-spectral-Algorithms-for-Statistical-Field-Theories`

The source code for analyzing the convergence and stability of the numerical schemes, additional analysis for the SAO, and a stand-alone implementation for the CGL equation is available in `Navdeep/`.
The source code to simulate the Model A, Model B, and the KPZ equation, as well as the data generated in simulations and recipes to create the plots is available in `Martin/`.
